# This is the wrangling file for the second analysis looking at whether there are differences in seed rain abundance, diversity, composition and phenology across the two mesh sizes
# This data will be analyzed as a split plot design.  Whole- Block (4); whole factor- trt group/overstory spp (4); Subplot/splitplot- plot (15); subplot/splitplot factor- mesh(2)

# This will require a summarized long format tidy file for abundance; a wide format tidy file for diversity and composition; pheno?? #not sure of pheno yet, will find out after meeting with stat help
