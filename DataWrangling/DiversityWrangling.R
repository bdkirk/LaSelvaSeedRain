# This involves wrangling of data so that tree effects on species diversity can be found
# Seed rain diversity: Richness, Shannon-Weiner diversity index, Evenness (Pielou's)
# There will be 15 total observations with traps summarised up to the plot level.
#Experimental design: RCBD, C. Total df = 14
